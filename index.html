		<h3>About Barcelos</h3>
			<p>Barcelos  is a city and a municipality in Braga District, in the north of Portugal. The population in 2011 was 120,391, in an area of 378.90 km. With 60 parishes, it is the municipality with the highest number of parishes in the country. It is one of the growing municipalities in the country, and is well known by its textile and adobe industries.

			Originally a Roman settlement, it expanded and became  the seat of the First Duke of Braganca in the 15th century. The palace of the Dukes of Braganca was destroyed by an earthquake in 1755 and is now an open-air museum.
			The town's famous symbol is a rooster, in Portuguese called o galo de Barcelos ("the Rooster of Barcelos").

		    One of the many versions of this legend goes that a rich man threw a big party. When the party was over, the rich man noticed that his sterling cutlery was stolen by a guest. He accused a pilgrim and let him go to court. He protested his innocence, but the judge didn't believe him. The judge was about to eat a roasted rooster when the pilgrim said: "If I am innocent, this rooster will crow three times." When the pilgrim was about to be lynched, the rooster crowed. The judge released the pilgrim. The story ends a few years later when the pilgrim returned and made a statue over the event.

		<h3> things to see in barcelos</h3>
	
	<p>
		
	1. Walks

Barcelos is one of the cities on the Portuguese Caminho de São Tiago da Compostela, or Way of Saint James so although Mike and I didn’t have time to venture much beyond the medieval bridge of Barcelinhos, we did notice several route markers and sweaty walkers as we wandered around the town centre. The tourist information centre should have some pocket leaflets with details of what you can see on the Barcelos stretch of the route. As you’d expect, the main highlights are chapels, churches and bridges, as well as pretty countryside.There are also plenty of other walks of about 3 to 4 hours duration in the surrounding area that take in windmills, villages, rivers and forests. Ask at the tourist information office about Percursos de Pequena Rota (PR) short walks or look out for the signs and coloured route markers. Don’t forget to take plenty of water with you.
 </p>
 <p>
	2. Pottery 

Barcelos has inspired many varieties of ceramics and pottery over the years, from earthenware pots to bushy-eyebrowed ladies. We tried to visit the pottery museum, Museu de Olaria, but the building was closed for renovations. Luckily, the tourist information office had an impressive array of ceramic figurines on display that reflect the range of styles and the local culture. The museum may be open again by the time you visit but check first.
</p>
<p>
	3. Thursday market

Noisy, chaotic and rich with colour and life, the weekly market in Barcelos attracts people from the Minho region to buy and sell all manner of things. You’ll find cheap clothes and shoes, fresh fruit and vegetables, lots of ceramics, lampshades, kitchenware, traditional tools and farming equipment as well as souvenirs and handicrafts. The Barcelos market  started life as an annual event in 15th century and remains an important element of the local economy and culture.
</p>
<p>
	4. Archaeological Museum

I loved the fact that the Museu Arqueológico is not only free but puts the ruined Counts of Barcelos Palace to good use. It’s open to the skies and overlooks Barcelinhos across the river as well as a 15th century manor house. The exhibits in this museum are made of stone and tiles and continue to withstand the elements centuries after they were made. This is where you’ll find the stone Crucifix to the Lord of the Rooster (Cruzeiro do Senhor do Galo) which was erected by the poor fellow who only escaped death because of a rooster.
</p>
<p>
	5. Timeless shops

The main shopping street of Barcelos, Rua António Barroso isn’t long but if you want to step back in time, visit one of the many shops that haven’t changed a bit since they first opened decades ago. There are modern shops, too, of course, but these treasures offer a glimpse into a different way of life.
</p>
<p>
	6. Handicrafts

As well as ceramics, there are plenty of other handmade products on offer in Barcelos, some of which you can watch being made. As soon as we entered the showroom cum workshop of the coppersmith, he grabbed a mallet, plonked himself on a stool and started bashing away at a copper bowl for our entertainment. He’s got a collection of tools that would set many a man’s heart racing and some very fine pieces for sale.

We found another metal worker purely by chance. I happened to glance through an open window and spotted this guy transforming tin cans into what look like mini watering cans but I suspect they are for pouring olive oil. You can buy them at the market and souvenir shops.
</p>

<p>

	7. River beaches and summer fun

If you visit Barcelos in July or August, the patch of sand by the Barcelinhos side of the bridge will probably be covered with sunbathers although when Mike and I visited in early September, there were only a couple of people soaking up the sun. The posters advertising the summer’s entertainment were still dotted around town though and it seems there’s plenty of live music and discos throughout the summer season.
</p>

<p>
	8. Outdoor cafés

We spotted two pleasant-looking riverside café bars, In Rio has terraces on the Barcelos side, while D’Outro Lado is literally on the other side and has a grassy garden and a marquee. There’s also a scruffy (but authentic) football bar just up the road from D’Outro Lado which is decorated with football scarves and graffiti and has a dusty garden with plastic chairs if you like that sort of thing. The town centre has plenty of cafés with outdoor seating, perfect for a spot of people watching.
</p>

<p>
	9. Architecture

If, like me, you’re a fan of old buildings, sculpted stonework, colourful tiles and swirly railings, you’ll have fun wandering around Barcelos. The historic centre is quite small but there’s a wide range of architectural styles and features for the keen-eyed. I particularly liked the four stone figures on the wall of the 18th century Benfeito manor house. Each one represents a different season; it looks as though winter is grim up north!
